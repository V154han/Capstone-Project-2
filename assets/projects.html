                                        <li>As well as the features provided from the original dataset, extra features were extracted online such as GDP as well as using current features to make more features, e.g. the number of times a person failed to make a transaction</li>
                                        <li>Trialled out multiple Machine Learning Models including Random Forest & XGBoost and then ulimately chose the model that provided the lowest number of False Negatives</li>
