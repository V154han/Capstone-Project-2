                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to my profile! My name is Visahan Sritharan and I currently work as a Machine 
                    Learning Engineer however I have also undertaken projects in the field of Data Engineering and Data 
                    Analytics. Throughout my journey, I have familiarzed myself with a vast array of tech stacks, including
                    Python, SQL, Alteryx & Snowflake and now I'm looking to add HTML and JavaScript to the list too!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Despite graduating from the University of Nottingham with a First Class in Aerospace Engineering in 2022, I was still
                    unsure as to what I wanted to do with my career - and that's when I found my passion for technology. I would spend a lot of
                    time outside my working hours learning and improving my coding abilities as I find it to be super interesting and this has led to 
                    where I am now.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now I have started my newest journey in the world of coding - and that is web development! This is my first ever website that I've
                    built purely from HTML and CSS and have tried to minimize the amount of bootstrap that I'm using to really familiarze myself with using
                    CSS. I'm looking forward to have you join me in my journey!
                </p>
